Have multiple programs in the same folder? Remember to add them to the end of your setup.py file inside the folder:

  ...
  entry_points={
   'console_scripts': [
   'abc123_publisher = abc123_demo.abc123_publisher:main',
   'abc123_subscriber = abc123_demo.abc123_subscriber:main'
   ],
  ...

No executable found?
  Did you remember to "colcon build" in the ~/ros2_ws directory?
